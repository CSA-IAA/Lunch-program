# Lunch-program
My midterm for Computer Programming II. 

Employees are able to quickly purchase their lunch during their break time. They are offered different types of drinks and food which they can buy when they enter their Employee ID and payment method. They can calculate the cost of the lunch when they select a drink and food option. The progress bar is displayed at the right end of the GUI. The employee's ID and total lunch price is saved to a file.
